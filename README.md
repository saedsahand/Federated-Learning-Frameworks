# Federated-Learning-Frameworks
In this project, we have implemented Google (TFF) and Flower federated learning frameworks and have done data poisoning and model poisoning within a bug prediction experiment.   

The dataset contains buggy and non buggy source codes in Python. The bugs are defined as run time errors. A nueral network has been defined to be trained on this dataset, and predict runtime time errors in Python source codes.
We have implemented both TensorFlow Federated learning (TFF) and Flower framewoks and have done two experiments for checking their accuracy and compare them. The experiments are data poisoning and model poisoning.
